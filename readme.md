# Snippets for Python
based on Mosh's [Python Tutorial - Full Course for Begginers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&)

**Hello there, I'm known here as Bytes ðŸ‘‹**
* This is my first public repository here in GitHub, it contains a collection of code snippets for python based in the exercises  shown in the tutorial.
* Feel free to leave any suggestion and sorry if I make any spelling mistake. Even though I know English, I'm still prone to some silly mistakes. My main language is Spanish.
### Content Index
* app.py is the main file, running it will print in the terminal all the examples. I personally recommend you to open the file in your text editor in order to read the comments
* "/basics" is a folder designated for all the basic knowledge of Python, I've added two examples and every contribution is welcome, just keep it simple.
* "/utils" contains all the personalized modules used in the main file, you can also add an small application with its proper description.

### Some words
* I'm glad of being part of this community and I'm willing to learn more about data science and programming in general.
* You can find me on Discord as "bytes255".
